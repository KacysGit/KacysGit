Welcome to my GitHub! My name is Kacy. I am interested in leadership and teamwork positions and my goal is to become a product manager. 
I am currently studying computer science at Texas State University and graduate in December, 2023. I plan on attending the University of Texas in Austin
in fall 2024 to earn a master's in business administration.
